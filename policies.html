            <div class="body-text interior-pages__text">
              <p>Parents are welcome at all times to make appointments to discuss concerns they may have. Kindly phone the office to make appointments with the relevant staff at mutually agreeable times. <br><br>It is preferable that issues are first resolved at the Class Guardian Educator level. Should the issue not be resolved satisfactorily, parents are invited to contact the Head of Department of the Phase or Deputy Principal.
              Should the issues still be unresolved, and the amicable resolution of a parent/s grievance no longer be possible. <br><br>
               <span class="subheading">the following formal procedure is recommended for parents to follow:</span>
               <ol class="post_list">
                 <li>Print out the grievance document below or you may request a form at the office. Complete the grievance document, in order to facilitate further action on the part of the school.</li>
                 <li>Submit the document to the Principal as soon as possible.</li>
                 <li>Make yourself available for an enquiry into the complaint, or a meeting with a member of the management of the school or the Principal.</li>
                 <li>Should the complaint prove to be intractable, reserve your right to remove your child from the school in the best interests of your child and the school. This action, however, will in no way negate your obligations in terms of the Contract of Enrolment.</li>
                 <li>The parent should complete the first sections of the Grievance Form that requests a range of information that will enable the school to follow up on the grievance.</li>
                 <li>The Principal will then initiate an investigation of the parent/s grievance, and take the appropriate steps to attempt to resolve the grievance, in the interests of the school and the learner / parent.</li>
                 <li>Should the grievance not be resolved to the satisfaction of the parent, a more formal process of reconciliation / mediation will be set up to bring the matter to conclusion.</li>
                 <li>Whilst parents may not agree with every decision by the school, in most cases, the parent and school will find enough common ground to continue a mutually respectful relationship. In the extreme case, however, an impasse may be so severe that both the parent and the school should consider whether another school would be a better match for the family.</li>
                 <li>Should the breakdown in the relationship between the school and parents (or the learner) be considered to be irreparable, or should the school and the parents be unable to agree on a positive way forward to resolve the impasse, the Principal may need to consider instituting cautionary measures against the parents and/or even revoking the Contract of Enrolment. (See the Cautionary Procedure for Parents below)</li>
               </ol><br>
              </p class="body-text">Please note that it is the sincere intention of the board and management of the school to take all grievances seriously, to investigate them fully and to resolve them as quickly as possible in the interests of the learners and family affected, and of the school itself. </p>
            </p class="body-text">To that end, the school would like to appeal to parents submitting the grievance to be realistic in their expectations in terms of how the grievance could be resolved. <br><br> <strong>Add form here</strong></p> <br>

              CAUTIONARY PROCEDURE FOR PARENT(S)
            </h4>

            <h5>Step 1 : Consultation (Parent & Head)</h5>
            <ol class="post_list">
              <li>Set up a meeting with the parent to discuss the issue causing friction.</li>
              <li>Define the problem rationally, while acknowledging the emotional dimension. (Make the parent feel heard).</li>
              <li>Invite the parents solution.</li>
              <li>Remain solution-centred, building for a maximum win-win situation (us against the problem rather than school vs parent).</li>
              <li>Record the interview in writing and follow up with a letter to the parent summarising the key aspects of the interview.</li>
            </ol> <br>

            <h5>Step 2 : Calling To Account: A Written Caution / Warning</h5>
            <ol class="post_list">
              <li>Should the negative behaviour continue or become worse, it is suggested the Head write a formal letter to the parent that includes the following:</li>
              <ol class="post_list">
                <li>A description of the behaviour causing concern.</li>
                <li>A summary of previous conversations/meetings and the schools attempts to resolve the issues causing the behaviour.</li>
                <li>The reasons that the continued negative behaviour is unacceptable from the schools point of view, perhaps with reference to the schools Vision/Mission Statement, Code of Conduct or ethos.</li>
                <li>A request that the parent acknowledge receipt of the letter within 7 days and make an appointment with the Head should s/he wish to discuss the matter further.</li>
                <li>A statement that further action (internal or legal) against the parent might be taken should the negative behaviour not cease immediately. This action could be in the form of a formal interview or hearing</li>
              </ol>
            </ol> <br>

            <h5>Step 3: Formal Interview / Cautionary Hearing</h5>
            <ol class="post_list">
              <li>Should no response be received from the parent and should the negative behaviour continue regardless, the parent should be called in to a Cautionary  Hearing with the Head. The conditions for conducting a (disciplinary) process need to be strictly adhered to:</li>
              <ol class="post_list">
                <li> The parent must be given reasonable notice (7-14 days) that the interview will take the form of a formal hearing.</li>
                <li>S/he must be notified of the time and venue for the hearing in writing.</li>
                <li>S/he must be informed of the details as to why the hearing is considered necessary, including details of the behaviours causing concern.</li>
                <li> S/he must be informed that the purpose of the hearing is:</li>
                  <ul class="post_list">
                    <li>To hear all relevant evidence concerning the matter.</li>
                    <li>To reach a just and balanced conclusion.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>S/he must be made aware of the fact that the outcome of the hearing may result in further action being taken against him/her, and may have consequences for the learner.</li>
              </ol>
            </ol> <br>

            <h5>Note: Hearing Procedure</h5>
            <p class="body-text">To ensure that the hearing procedure is properly conducted, all formal cautionary procedure hearings should be conducted in such a way as to promote the rules of natural justice i.e. the chairperson must</p>
            <ul class="post_list">
              <li>Should the negative behaviour continue or become worse, it is suggested the Head write a formal letter to the parent that includes the following:</li>
              <li>Open proceedings and ensure that the parent is fully informed of the charges against him/her</li>
              <li>Check that the parent is properly represented, or confirm if the parent does not need assistance or require representation (a friend or relative accompany him/her to the hearing)</li>
              <li>Ensure that the parent is presented with all facts and information relating to the allegations being made against them, if necessary through the presenting of evidence by relevant members of staff</li>
              <li>Provide the parent with an opportunity to challenge evidence presented, question any witnesses called by the school and to present any considerations in mitigation (should leniency be requested)</li>
              <li>Request the parent to present their own perspective and explain/defend their actions, if necessary by presenting any evidence or calling relevant witnesses</li>
              <li>Ask any questions to clarify the parents response to the charges</li>
              <li>Treat the parent with dignity and respect throughout the hearing</li>
              <li>Close the proceedings once all the relevant evidence has been presented and tested.</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p class="body-text">After the hearing has been concluded, the Chairperson adjourn the procedure to consider all the evidence heard.</p><br><br>

            <h5>Step 4: Communication of Outcome and Follow-Up</h5>
            <ol class="post_list">
              <li>Once the hearing has been completed, the Chairperson must carefully consider all the evidence heard and come to a decision as to what measures are to be taken against the parent (if any).</li>
              <li>Once this decision has been reached, this needs to be properly communicated to the parent. The parents right to appeal (to the Board of Governors) must also be communicated to the parent.</li>
              <li> To appeal, should s/he feel that the hearing or its outcome has been unfair, the parent should direct their appeal in writing via the Chairperson to the Executive Committee/ Board of Governors (delete) within 5 days of the hearing. The Board of Governors / Executive Committee will appoint an appropriate member to review the appeal and to make a finding regarding the appeal submitted. The reviewers finding should be communicated to the appellant / parent within 10 days of the appeal being received.</li>
              <ol class="post_list">
                <li>Should the parent accept the findings of the hearing, and wish to reach reconciliation, this should be allowed within certain pre-agreed parameters.</li>
                <li>Should the parent not be prepared to abide by the findings of the hearing, the following further action is recommended.</li>
              </ol>
            </ol> <br>

            <h5>Possible further measures aimed at the resolution of intractable grievances or differences</h5>
            <ol class="post_list">
              <li>The Head may need to seek legal advice. (This would need to have been communicated to the Board.)</li>
              <li>Subject to the outcome of any appeal process and prior to seeking legal advice, the Head may wish to invoke one or both of the following actions:</li>
              <ol class="post_list">
                <li>Revoking the right of admission to the school to prevent the parent harassing the staff, learners or other parents.</li>
                <li>Cancelling the educational contract (Refer to ISASA communication from Cliffe Decker Attorneys relating to Contract with Parents 21 January 2004).</li>
